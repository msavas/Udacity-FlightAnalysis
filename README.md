# Project Overview
This is an analysis of airport and carrier performance in the United States, as well as the causes behind poor performance. Poor performance is defined by delays and cancellations. I will also take a deep dive into Boston's Logan Airport to better understand my home airport's performance.

The datasets used for the analysis cover flight data for US carriers and airports between __2005-2008__. There are __28,745,461__ flights captured across __29__ variables.


## Exploratory Analysis (Part 1)
This notebook represents an exploration of the data. I created a series of visuals to uncover insights. I judged several visuals to be unnecessary or unimportant for reasons such as illegibility and irrelevance. The others I included in the explanatory analysis notebook.

## Explanatory Analysis (Part 2)
This notebook represents the key findings summarized via a series of questions, visuals, and insights. All visuals came from the exploratory analysis, but were cleaned up to include appropriate titles, legends, tick labels, and dimensions. 

## Main Findings
* The worst airport by performance is Chicago O’Hare (ORD). While not the busiest airport in the US it has by far the most cancellations. 
* Ironically, ExpressJet, is the worst performing carrier with the highest average arrival delay. 
* Boston’s Logan Airport suffers from weather challenges that increase cancellations in the winter.
